_Work on BookScreen and NotFoundScreen Styles_

### Morning question

- How to pass book data to the BookScreen component?
<hr/>

### BookScreen

We're gonna need: 
- Back to discover Link
- Show img, title, author, publishedAt, categories, description
- Review: rating + comment + submit
- Buttons for save the book in the bookshelf
- The body of the show page must be centered and have the book data
- NavBar and Footer?

### NotFoundScreen

- Back to discover Link
